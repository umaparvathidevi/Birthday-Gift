    <h2 style="color: purple;"><pre>                      It's been two years since we met, our bond from day one to 
till date is increasing enormously!! &#128525. I know many people in this world, also 
speaks with many but only few people stays in heart. Among those people you are
one for me. You stay in my heart not because you are my best friend but because 
of your helping nature,gratitude and innocence. I remember one fight happened
between us and when I think about you I always think that if that fight were not
happend on that day and if I moved just like saying it was okay no problem just 
like that, we might had remain as friends. But just because I showed my arrogance 
on you and you understood my arrogance on behalf of misunderstanding, our relation 
enhanced from friends to bestfriends dear.In this same way get ready to tolerate me 
till life long....</pre></h2>
